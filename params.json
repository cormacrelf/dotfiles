{"name":"Dotfiles","body":"# cormacrelf does dotfiles\r\n\r\n> Taken from Zach Holman's [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)\r\n\r\n## dotfiles\r\n\r\nYour dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. The very\r\nprejudiced mix: OS X, zsh, Ruby, Rails, git, homebrew, vim. If you\r\nmatch up along most of those lines, you may dig my dotfiles.\r\n\r\nI was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about\r\n(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to this\r\nproject being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot of things\r\nup into the main areas I used (Ruby, git, system libraries, and so on), so I\r\nstructured the project accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are\r\nawesome, you might want to [read my post on the\r\nsubject](http://zachcormacrelf.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).\r\n\r\n## install\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/cormacrelf/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`\r\n    cd ~/.dotfiles\r\n    rake install\r\n\r\nThe install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your\r\nhome directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nThe main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,\r\nwhich sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.\r\n\r\n## topical\r\n\r\nEverything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your\r\nforked dotfiles — say, \"Java\" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put\r\nfiles in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically\r\nincluded into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get\r\nsymlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `rake install`.\r\n\r\n## what's inside\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser\r\nabove and see what components may mesh up with you. Fork it, remove what you\r\ndon't use, and build on what you do use.\r\n\r\n## components\r\n\r\nThere's a few special files in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\r\n  available everywhere.\r\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\r\n  environment.\r\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into\r\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\r\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\r\n  symlinked in when you run `rake install`.\r\n- **topic/\\*.completion.sh**: Any files ending in `completion.sh` get loaded\r\n  last so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions.\r\n\r\n## add-ons\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They're not a required\r\ndependency, but if you install them they'll make your life a bit more like a\r\nbubble bath.\r\n\r\n- If you want some more colors for things like `ls`, install grc: `brew install\r\n  grc`.\r\n- You should probably install the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com) to manage\r\n  multiple rubies. With the latter, your current branch will show up in the prompt. Bonus.\r\n\r\n## bugs\r\n\r\nI want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should\r\nwork for you even though you may not have `rvm` installed, for example. That\r\nsaid, I do use this as *my* dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break\r\nsomething if I forget to make a check for a dependency.\r\n\r\nIf you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please\r\n[open an issue](https://github.com/cormacrelf/dotfiles/issues) or go to my \r\ndotfiles-donor, [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s \r\n[issues page](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues) on his repository\r\nand I'd love to get it fixed for you!\r\n\r\n## thanks\r\n\r\n... to Zach Holman, whose dotfiles repo is of the finest quality.\r\n","tagline":"@cormacrelf does dotfiles","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
