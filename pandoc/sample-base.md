Introduction
============

Almost half a century has passed since the American Law Institute (ALI) last 
made a sustained foray into choice of law: the 1971 Restatement (Second) of 
Conflicts.[@2017IndependentIntelligence2017] The ALI is currently at work on 
the Restatement (Third), which will take account of developments over the last 
five decades.[@andrewwilkieLackIntelligence2003] The changes are significant, 
but so are the continuities. Unfortunately, despite what its drafters would 
have us believe, the changes and continuities are not 
compatible.[@fieldsWhatClassifiedInformation]

> Do we respond [to the problems in remote communities] with more of what we 
have done in the past? Or do we radically change direction with an intervention 
strategy matched to the magnitude of the problem?

Body Text. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
```


### An h3 header ###

Do we respond [to the problems in remote communities] with more of what we have 
done in the past? Or do we radically change direction with an intervention 
strategy matched to the magnitude of the problem?

#### An h4 header

Do we respond [to the problems in remote communities] with more of what we have 
done in the past? Or do we radically change direction with an intervention 
strategy matched to the magnitude of the problem?

#### Another h4 header

Do we respond [to the problems in remote communities] with more of what we have 
done in the past? Or do we radically change direction with an intervention 
strategy matched to the magnitude of the problem?

#### One last h4 header

Do we respond [to the problems in remote communities] with more of what we have 
done in the past? Or do we radically change direction with an intervention 
strategy matched to the magnitude of the problem?

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

Name           Size  Material      Color
------------- -----  ------------  ------------
All Business      9  leather       brown
Roundabout       10  hemp canvas   natural
Cinderella       11  glass         transparent

Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
Keyword   Text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

And images can be specified like so:

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
