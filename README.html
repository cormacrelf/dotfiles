<h2 id="dotfiles">dotfiles</h2>

<p>Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. The very
prejudiced mix: OS X, zsh, Ruby, Rails, git, homebrew, rvm, vim. If you
match up along most of those lines, you may dig my dotfiles.</p>

<p>I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about
(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to this
project being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot of things
up into the main areas I used (Ruby, git, system libraries, and so on), so I
structured the project accordingly.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to <a href="http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/">read my post on the
subject</a>.</p>

<h2 id="install">install</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>git clone git://github.com/holman/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles</code></li>
<li><code>cd ~/.dotfiles</code></li>
<li><code>rake install</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in <code>.dotfiles</code> to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within <code>~/.dotfiles</code>,
though.</p>

<p>The main file you&#8217;ll want to change right off the bat is <code>zsh/zshrc.symlink</code>,
which sets up a few paths that&#8217;ll be different on your particular machine.</p>

<h2 id="topical">topical</h2>

<p>Everything&#8217;s built around topic areas. If you&#8217;re adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, &#8220;Java&#8221; — you can simply add a <code>java</code> directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of <code>.zsh</code> will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of <code>.symlink</code> will get
symlinked without extension into <code>$HOME</code> when you run <code>rake install</code>.</p>

<h2 id="whatsinside">what&#8217;s inside</h2>

<p>A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you. Fork it, remove what you
don&#8217;t use, and build on what you do use.</p>

<h2 id="components">components</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a few special files in the hierarchy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bin/</strong>: Anything in <code>bin/</code> will get added to your <code>$PATH</code> and be made
 available everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>topic/*.zsh</strong>: Any files ending in <code>.zsh</code> get loaded into your
 environment.</li>
<li><strong>topic/*.symlink</strong>: Any files ending in <code>*.symlink</code> get symlinked into
 your <code>$HOME</code>. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
 but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
 symlinked in when you run <code>rake install</code>.</li>
<li><strong>topic/*.completion.sh</strong>: Any files ending in <code>completion.sh</code> get loaded
 last so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-ons">add-ons</h2>

<p>There are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They&#8217;re not a required
dependency, but if you install them they&#8217;ll make your life a bit more like a
bubble bath.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want some more colors for things like <code>ls</code>, install grc: <code>brew install
  grc</code>.</li>
<li>If you install the excellent <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com">rvm</a> to manage
 multiple rubies, your current branch will show up in the prompt. Bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugs">bugs</h2>

<p>I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should
work for you even though you may not have <code>rvm</code> installed, for example. That
said, I do use this as <em>my</em> dotfiles, so there&#8217;s a good chance I may break
something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
<a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues">open an issue</a> on this repository
and I&#8217;d love to get it fixed for you!</p>

<h2 id="thanks">thanks</h2>

<p>I forked <a href="http://github.com/ryanb">Ryan Bates</a>&#8217; excellent
<a href="http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> for a couple years before the
weight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan&#8217;s
dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship
to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan&#8217;s original project.</p>
